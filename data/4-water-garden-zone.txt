ðŸ’¦ Stop #4 â€“ Shhh... can you hear it? The sound pulls you in â€” rushing, rippling, echoing like footsteps through a futuristic temple. Welcome to the Water Gardens Zone: part oasis, part dreamscape, and fully iconic. ðŸ’§ðŸŒ†

Built in 1974 by famed architect Philip Johnson, the Fort Worth Water Gardens are a geometric descent into sound and motion. Water doesnâ€™t just flow here â€” it falls, whispers, and roars. Youâ€™re not just walking into a park â€” youâ€™re stepping into an elemental ritual.

Feel the mist on your face. Lose your balance (figuratively). Channel your inner philosopher, or your inner child. Either works. Just donâ€™t fall in â€” itâ€™s happened before. ðŸ˜¬ðŸ’¦

Time bends in this zone. Stay too long, and you may start to feel like water. ðŸŒ€
