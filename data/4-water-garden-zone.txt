    <h2>💦 Water Gardens Zone<br><small>Fort Worth Water Gardens</small></h2>

      Designed in 1974 by architect Philip Johnson, the Water Gardens are like an acoustic dream — cascading water and concrete geometry meet in perfect harmony. 💧🎶

      This zone invites you to slow your pace, feel the mist, and descend into sound. Let the waves reset your senses. Just don’t fall in. (Seriously.) 😅🌀
