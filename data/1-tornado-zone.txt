🌪️ Stop #1 – In 2000, an F3 tornado tore through the Linwood neighborhood, leveling homes and shaking the foundations of this historic community. For years, the area sat in quiet recovery — a patchwork of empty lots and resilient neighbors. Today, Linwood has transformed into a walkable, vibrant district full of townhomes, trails, and hidden gems.

At the heart of it all is Jesse D. Sandoval Park — named after a beloved city council member and community leader. This zone honors Linwood’s past while kicking off our tour with a toast to rebirth, resilience, and a neighborhood that weathered the storm. 🌪️🌳🍻
