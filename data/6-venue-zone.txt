🎶 Stop #6 – Set along the banks of the Trinity River, Panther Island Pavilion is Fort Worth’s open-air stage for sound, sky, and celebration. Just across the water from the sleek Tarrant County College campus — a modern architectural gem — this venue blends the natural and the urban like nowhere else.

To the south, the historic Paddock Viaduct arches overhead, once the only way into downtown by car. And behind the stage? A half-forgotten Art Deco power plant looms like a monument to another era — rusted, regal, and weirdly perfect for the setting. ⚡🏗️

This is where Fort Worth gets loud. From river floats to full-blown festivals, the Pavilion is a place where summer lingers, music echoes off the levees, and you dance barefoot because... why not?

The tour ends here — but the night is just getting started. 🎉🌅
