💼 Stop #3 – Step carefully — the patterns beneath your feet have a strange rhythm here. 👁‍🗨 At Burk Burnett Park, the sharp-angled sidewalks feel like a coded message... and the aluminum silhouette of a man with a briefcase seems to be going somewhere. But where? 👤🧳

Some say he’s late for a meeting. Others say he’s walking into another dimension. This zone invites you to slow down and look around — peer through the windows of nearby buildings and you might spot actual dinosaur bones on display. Yes, seriously. 🦖

And just beneath your feet? An old subway system, long sealed off and half-forgotten. The city above moved on... but something down there might still be moving. 👀🚇

Don’t get left behind. This zone has edges. Stay sharp. 🌀
